It's about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars"

You’re going to have very physical jobs to do like setting up reactors, drilling for water, performing geological surveys and in general laying the keel for a Martian colony. This is the stuff that isn’t suited to remote operation— this is why we’re sending people — but even if it were, it would be much more easily and safely done from inside the Starship"
